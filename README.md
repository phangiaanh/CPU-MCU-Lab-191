# CPU-MCU-Lab-191
This project includes all lab exercises which i have done in the CPU-MCU course at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology.
# TimerToBlink
This lab contains two tasks, mainly used to understand how to configure interrupts in the ESP8266.
# DigitalClock
Just a simple clock with multiple modes to use.
# AdvancedTimer
This is a scheduler at its basic form. I implemented it using linked list. Could be done better if we replace linked list with array.
# 74HC595
It's empty because i did not have much time to do. Its purpose at first is to test the 74HC595 with 7 segment LEDs.
# LTD
Low Temperature Dehydration - The final lab in this course.
